# 🐍 FastAPI Code Refactoring Task

## 🎯 Objective

You are given a basic FastAPI application in a single file (main.py). It performs the following tasks:

- Reads a text file (data.txt) containing lines in the format: Name,Age
- Parses the data into a list of users
- Returns the list of users in JSON format from a GET /users API endpoint
- Saves the parsed users to output.json

Your task is to restructure this project into a clean and maintainable FastAPI project using standard Python practices.

## 📂 Your Tasks

1. Break the current one-file code into separate modules and packages.

2. The functionality of the app should remain the same.


## 💡 What We're Looking For

- Project structure (clean separation of concerns)
- Naming and file organization
- Code readability and basic error handling
- Familiarity with FastAPI and Pydantic
